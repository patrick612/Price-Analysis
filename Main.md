# Price Pattern Analysis
## Introduction
The purpose of this personal project is to seek information contained in time series data for stocks and bitcoins only by looking at the time series data. The assumption is that the time series contains specific narratives and hidden information about its state and I seek to capture such by viewing them as  invariances of time series in certain neighborhoods of various state spaces.

For example if a stock price resides within a certain range of price after the morning heat cools off at around noon, we see an invariance in price within a certain time frame. Likewise, if a price of a stock rallies in a rising trend with high volatility as the market starts, we could describe such behavior as showing invariances of time series in volatility space.

Jesse Livermore mentions in his book "How to Trade in Stocks" to recognize a critical point of stock prices and to trade after the penetration of the critical point. Such critical points are the price points which has been challenged with high trading volumes in the past but has not been penetrated in local time frame. If we know what spaces it would take to describe such point and are able to capture invariances in such spaces, we could train an algorithm to search for critical points and deduce the bayesian probability of price behaviors afterwards. For example the moving average of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dp}{dV}"> $\frac{dp}{dV}$($p$ for price, $V$ for volume) would be in a low neighborhood and $log(V)$ would reside in some high neighborhood as price challenges the critical point as a lot of trading volume activities occur. Then, once penetrated, the $\frac{dp}{dV}$ would shoot up as price is being easily pushed relative to volume. State spaces and neighborhoods allow to describe a state of commodity price so, we must construct a bayesian algorithm to find meaningful states that are highly correlated to certain future movements.

In a sense this method generalizes technical analysis in a systematic and probabilistic manner. Technical analysis indices such as MACD, RSI, momentum, stochastic %, etc are examples of infinitely many state spaces that express specific and often meaningful information. We must note that these state spaces are not just distorted meaningless representation of information. For example, volatility which uses variance, is just a function of price, but tells us about degree of variation in price movements. However, such indices do not work all the time. Therefore,  we must build a build a bayesian algorithm which would figure out when certain indices are meaningful and correlated to certain future movements.

The algorithm must be able to find meaningful state spaces which lead to higher correlations to future movements. In order for the program to tell us, "if a stock is in neighborhood N1 in state space S1, N2 in S2, N3 in S3, the price has 65% chance of moving to neighborhood N4," we need three algorithms:

1. Point grouping algorithm. This algorithm will find set of consecutive points that reside in a certain neighborhood (range). Through this algorithm, we will be able to pick out segments of time series evolution that display group behaviors in various state spaces.

2. State space search algorithm. This will search for meaningful and informative state spaces and probably be the toughest to build. My current thought is to search space of tensors (for nonlinear equations, we can trade finite dimensions for nonlinearity). But we could start by considering comprehensive set of technical indicators that have been used throughout history.

3. Bayesian algorithm. After we have the tools to express a time series as invariance in neighborhoods in different state spaces, we need to find correlations with a future set. That is this algorithm should find states that give high bayesian probability of future event.
